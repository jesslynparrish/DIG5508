In this free project, I decided to work on exercise 7-2 from the textbook. 

I created a simple currency converter for the example, and chose to convert dollars to euros or dirham, and convert euros to dollars. Part of my decision was in thinking about some of the trips I took when living abroad during my master's (when I lived in Ireland, but was lucky enough to visit Morocco).
