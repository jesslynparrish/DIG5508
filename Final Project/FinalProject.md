*Summary: What & Why
 I want to create interactive webpages and games that users can play with and engages them with a topic. To gain practice with this, I decided to try my hand at creating a holiday-themed activity. Building on the skills learned in Lab 3, I decided to build on the code and reframing it into a holiday theme in order to create a more meaningful experience. For this program, the user can create a Christmas wreath by clicking their mouse. The background with circles going past at different speeds are meant to simulate Christmas lights while the user creates a wreath in the foreground.
 
 *Features: (user-facing description of what program does) (have 2-3)
 - User can interact via keys or mouseclicks
 - Program simulates holiday lights through using moving circles going across the screen
 - Allows user to draw a wreath by clicking the mouse in order to place green rectangles
