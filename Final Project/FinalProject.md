Final Project Idea: Create an ELO submission? Potential topic areas: mental health, language
Something in unity?
First: do some unity tutorials, write out notes/mapping ideas of potential ideas

11/20/19 Update:
Need final project idea tonight. 
Create a game in Unity, involves
  designing the environment
  programming element: 
    can you program the character/player and how they can interact with the environment? 
    program how to win the game?
    Unity has lots of tutorials for guiding you through how to create your first game, can I use those to create and program 
    my game?

Okay, goal for this final project: CREATE SOMETHING FUN IN PROCESSING!
  Look through the examples directory and look for a few things that look fun and use them in something similiar to what we     did in lab 3! You can do this, it'll be fun!
  
 I will also watch some basic tutorials on Unity (i.e. intro tutorials Dr. Murray sent us via webcourses) and decide if I can handle it - and if I decide I can, then I can do that in Unity. But the fallback will be creating something in processing.

 *Summary: What & Why
 I want to create interactive webpages and games that users can play with and engages them with a topic.
 
 *Features: (user-facing description of what program does) (have 2-3)
 - User can interact via keys or mouseclicks
 - User will play a game to gain insight to learn about
 - program displays ____ (example)
 - allows user to draw using ____ (example)
 Document your process as you work on each part of the plan and how you break it down

Does it go beyond what we've described/done in class? (we can tackle a simple problem)
Encourages us to stay below 100 lines of code total (more than 5-10 lines, but less than 100)
