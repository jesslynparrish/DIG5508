#Processing and Canvas
#What did we learn?
    #File systems & operating systems
    #variables and value types (a named place for some data that will be used in a program - and can be used multiple times)
    #functions, parameters and return values 
    #iterations and conditionals (for & if statements)
    #files, input and output
    #image manipulation at the pixel level 
    #analysis of texts through a library and an external API
#Object has 2 things associated with it: variables and functions
#function: way of storing and reusing bits of code
#Blender and RenPy use Python
#Why Python?
    #interpreted (no compilation step)
    #no scaffolding required
    #support for classes and a robust module system (libraries)
    #supports jupyter notebooks
    #popular for machine learning 
#Processing (2nd platform we will see/use today)
    #framework for creative coding in multiple languages
    #can be used for exploration and experimentation
    #goals are to minimize friction and to maximize support for media programming
    #"sketches" are project files that cotain code, assets, & a mode
#Lab 2 common problems
