#Processing and Canvas
#What did we learn?
    #File systems & operating systems
    #variables and value types (a named place for some data that will be used in a program - and can be used multiple times)
    #functions, parameters and return values 
    #iterations and conditionals (for & if statements)
    #files, input and output
    #image manipulation at the pixel level 
    #analysis of texts through a library and an external API
#Object has 2 things associated with it: variables and functions
#function: way of storing and reusing bits of code
#Blender and RenPy use Python
#Why Python?
    #interpreted (no compilation step)
    #no scaffolding required
    #support for classes and a robust module system (libraries)
    #supports jupyter notebooks
    #popular for machine learning 
#Processing (2nd platform we will see/use today)
    #framework for creative coding in multiple languages
    #can be used for exploration and experimentation
    #goals are to minimize friction and to maximize support for media programming
    #"sketches" are project files that cotain code, assets, & a mode
#Lab 2 common problems


#Processing notes:
    #Processing uses Java
    #java is an interpreted langauge
    #he will post the slides from class if you need to refer to it
    #blocks of code are interpreted with {} (i think? or is it JS?)
    #processing is a large library of functions that can be used
#Final Project:
    #could take a Processing element and expand on it, add detail to it
    #interactive design work? you're interested in that
